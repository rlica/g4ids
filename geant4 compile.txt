For example with the B2 example,
mkdir $HOME/buildB2
cd buildB2
cmake -DGeant4_DIR=$G4COMP $G4EXAMPLES/basic/B2
make -j2 (make -j4)
cd B2a
./exampleB2a



RUN from console:

      /run/initialize
Idle> /run/beamOn 100

Invoke a Geant4 process and perform visualization with the VRML-Network driver. For example:
       
       Idle> /vis/open VRML2
       Idle> /vis/drawVolume 
       Idle> /vis/viewer/update
             /vis/viewer/refresh

       
In step 4, 3D scene data are sent from the remote host to the local host as VRML-formatted data, and the VRML viewer specified in step 3 is invoked by the g4vrmlview process to visualize the VRML data. The transferred VRML data are saved as a file named g4.wrl in the current directory of the local host.
